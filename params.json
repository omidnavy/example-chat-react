It demonstrates how a complex, stateful application should be built.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:vieuxio/example-chat-react.git\r\n$ cd example-chat-react\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure you have gulp installed:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo npm install -g gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to run the project. After you execute this command, the project will start automatically on your browser.\r\n```\r\n$ gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nThis project provides a development web server that listens on port 1970.\r\n\r\nRun the default task via `gulp` and the project will be ready for development and inspection. Source files are symlinked, and the server watches for file changes with live reloading, so any change you make to the files under `src` folder will cause an automatic reload.\r\n\r\n## Production builds\r\n\r\nWhen you are satisfied with development and want to make a production build in order to deploy the app, just run the `gulp`.\r\n\r\nThe live-reloading watch server can also be activated for these kind of builds via `gulp`.\r\n\r\nHappy coding!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
